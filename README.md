### Git Strategy

Please create new features as Pull Requests in new branches forked from `master` and be sure any work in progress is marked as a **Draft**.

![DraftPR](https://github.com/bancorprotocol/webapp/raw/master/docs/media/draftPr.png)

- Always link new PRs to their original issue.
- Assign Asaf as a reviewer and tag the Bancor v2 project for anything to be reviewed prior to going into production.
